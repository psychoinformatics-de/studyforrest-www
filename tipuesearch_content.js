Made available are raw data, preprocessed data, and an extensive collection of annotations of the movie. Often, multiple data types are available for the same set of participants — for example, multiple fMRI scans of up to 10 hours total per participant. Below is an overview of all major components of the StudyForrest dataset. This includes data relating to brain structure, brain function, and movie stimulus properties. Further details for each data type can be found in the linked publications. Enable JavaScript to filter through data types. Behavior and Brain Function A diverse set of stimulation paradigms and data acquisition setups were utilized to characterize participant's brain function on a variety of dimensions. High-res 7T fMRI on 2h Audio Movie (+Cardiac/Respiration) Publication Explore 7T, audio, cardiac, respiration Two principle data modalities were acquired: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) fMRI scans, continuously capturing brain activity at a spatial resolution of 1.4 mm, and physiological recordings of heart beat and breathing. For technical validation, all measurements are also available for a full-length gel phantom scan. High-res 7T fMRI Listening to Music (+Cardiac/Respiration) Publication Explore 7T, music, cardiac, respiration High-resolution, ultra high-field (7 Tesla) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from 20 participants that were repeatedly stimulated with a total of 25 music clips, with and without speech content, from five different genres using a slow event-related paradigm. Physiological recordings of heart beat and breathing were simultaneously recorded as well. 3T fMRI on 2h Movie, Eyegaze (+Cardiac/Respiration) Publication Explore 3T, audio, eyegaze, cardiac, respiration Two-hour 3 Tesla fMRI acquisition while 15 participants were shown an audio-visual version of the stimulus motion picture, simultaneously recording eye gaze location, heart beat, and breathing. Retinotopic Mapping Publication 3T, retinotopic mapping, visual cortex, eccentricity, polar angle Standard 3 mm fMRI recording of a retinotopic mapping procedure with expanding and contracting ring and rotating wedge stimuli. Resulting eccentricity and polar angle maps of the visual cortex of 15 participants are available. Higher Visual Area Localizer Publication Explore 3T, visual area localizer, block-design, one-back task 3mm fMRI data from a standard block-design visual area localizer using greyscale images for the stimulus categories human faces, human bodies without heads, small objects, houses and outdoor scenes comprising of nature and street scenes, and phase scrambled images. Multi-res 3T/7T fMRI (0.8-3mm) on Visual Orientation Publication 7T, 3T, visual, oriented gratings, decoding Ultra high-field 7T and 3T fMRI data recorded at 0.8 (7T-only), 1.4, 2, and 3 mm isotropic voxel size under stimulation with flickering, oriented grating stimuli. Grating orientation in the left and right visual field varied independently to enable decoding analyses. Brain Structure and Connectivity A versatile set of structural brain images are available to provide a comprehensive in-vivo assessment of all participants' brain hardware. T1-weighted MRI Publication 3T, T1 An image with 274 sagittal slices (FoV 191.8×256×256 mm) and an acquisition voxel size of 0.7 mm with a 384×384 in-plane reconstruction matrix (0.67 mm isotropic resolution) was recorded using a 3D turbo field echo (TFE) sequence (TR 2500 ms, inversion time (TI) 900 ms, flip angle 8 degrees, echo time (TE) 5.7 ms, bandwidth 144.4 Hz/px, Sense reduction AP 1.2, RL 2.0, scan duration 12:49 min). T2-weighted MRI Publication 3T, T2 A 3D turbo spin-echo (TSE) sequence (TR 2500 ms, TEeff 230 ms, strong SPIR fat suppression, TSE factor 105, bandwidth 744.8 Hz/px, Sense reduction AP 2.0, RL 2.0, scan duration 7:40 min) was used to acquire an image whose geometric properties otherwise match the T1-weighted image. Susceptibility-weighted MRI Publication 3T, SWI An image with 500 axial slices (thickness 0.35 mm, FoV 181×202×175 mm) and an in-plane acquisition voxel size of 0.7 mm reconstructed at 0.43 mm (512×512 matrix) was recorded using a 3D Presto fast field echo (FFE) sequence (TR 19 ms, TE shifted 26 ms, flip angle 10 degrees, bandwidth 217.2 Hz/px, NSA 2, Sense reduction AP 2.5, FH 2.0, scan duration 7:13 min). Diffusion-weighted MRI Publication Explore 3T, DTI Diffusion data were recorded with a diffusion-weighted single-shot spin-echo EPI sequence (TR 9545 ms, TE 80 ms, strong SPIR fat suppression, bandwidth 2058.4 Hz/px, Sense reduction AP 2.0) using 32 diffusion-sensitizing gradient directions with b=800smm2b=800smm2 (two samples for each direction), 70 slices (thickness of 2 mm and an in-plane acquisition voxel size of 2×2 mm, reconstructed at 1.7×1.7 mm, 144×144 in-plane matrix, FoV 224×248×140 mm). Acquisition duration was 12:38 min. Angiography Publication 7T, angiography A 3D multi-slab time-of-flight angiography was recorded at 7 Tesla for the FoV of the fMRI recording. Four slabs with 52 slices (thickness 0.3 mm) each were recorded (192×144 mm FoV, in-plane resolution 0.3×0.3 mm, GRAPPA acceleration factor 2, phase encoding direction right-to-left, 15.4% slice oversampling, 24 ms TR, 3.84 ms TE). Cortical Surface Reconstruction Publication Explore derivative Reconstructed cortical surfaces meshes and various associated estimates were generated from the T1 and T2-weighted images of each participant using the FreeSurfer 5.3 image segmentation and reconstruction pipeline. Movie Stimulus Annotations Annotating the content of the Forrest Gump movie, the key stimulus used in the project, is an open-ended endeavour. Its naturalistic nature is rich in diverse visual and auditory features, but also the facets of social communication enables and requires a versatile description. Location Changes and Time Progression Publication movie, annotation, cut, scenes, time progression, location Start and end times for all scenes in the cut of the movie that is used as the stimulus. In addition, each annotation contains whether a scene takes place indoors or outdoors. Additionally, temporal location of all cuts in the movie (only applicable to visual stimulation). Cuts were initially detected using an automated procedure and were then later curated by hand. Speech Publication movie, annotation, speech, grammar, word, dialog The exact timing of each of the more than 2,500 spoken sentences, 16,000 words (including 202 non-speech vocalizations), 66,000 phonemes, and their corresponding speaker. Additionally, every word is associated with a grammatical category, and its syntactic dependencies are defined. Portrayed Emotions Publication movie, annotation, emotion, arousal, valence, cue Description of portrayed emotions in the movie and the audio description stimulus. The nature of an emotion is characterized with basic attributes such as onset, duration, arousal, and valence — as well as explicit emotion category labels and a record of the perceptual evidence for the presence of an emotion. Semantic Conflict Publication movie, annotation, lies, irony Identification of episodes with portrayal of lies, irony, or sarcasm by three independent observers. Location Changes and Time Progression Publication movie, annotation An annotation of location and temporal progression in the movie. Body Contact Description movie, annotation, body parts, touch, body language A detailed description of all body contact events in the movie, including timing, actor and recipient, body parts involved, intensity and valence of the touch, and any potential audio cues. Eye Movement Labels Publication movie, annotation, eye gaze, saccades, fixations, smooth pursuit Classification of eye movements for two groups of 15 participants watching the movie: one group inside an MRI scanner and another group in a laboratory setting. Saccades, post-saccadic oscillations, fixations, and smooth pursuit events are distinguished. Music music, annotations, soundtrack, music Timing and identity of every musical piece in the movie's soundtrack.

The dataset comprises many diverse data types, ranging from brain imaging modalities to eye tracking to measurements of heart beat and respiration. This page offers a few demos to provide a glimpse into a selection of the data types and also a few quality metrics used to investigate the utility of the dataset. A comprehensive assessment can be found in the associated data papers that are available for every dataset component listed on the Data Page . The \"Hairy\" Brain Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is a technique that can be used to visualize neural tracts or nerve fibre bundles by measuring the direction of water diffusion in brain tissue. The example figure below shows a so-called connectome — the structure of nerve fibre pathways in the brain — estimated from the DWI data of a single individual. The red horizontal lines in the center of the image show the corpus callosum , the bridge between the two brain halves. The blue vertical lines in the lower center of the image show the corticospinal tract , where the brain is connected with the nervous system in other parts of the body. The provided scans have been made with a standard clinical procedure at 2 mm spatial resolution.

The Colorful World of Brain Function One way to analyze brain function is to contrast where the brain consumes oxygen differently between particular conditions. A number of such analysis results have been published on the NeuroVault platform to enable further meta-analysis. Browse through the topics and see how individual brain areas respond differently.

Processing of visual and non-visual naturalistic spatial information in the \"parahippocampal place area\" (paper in review). Brain Parcellations High-resolution structural brain images, such as those acquired with T1- and T2-weighted MRI, can be used to reconstruct and label regions on the cortical surface as well as subcortical brain structures. Such parcellations of the brain into distinct but interacting regions support research into the fundamentals of brain organization and function. Using the FreeSurfer software package, structural data from 20 subjects were reconstructed into brain parcellations. The animation below shows this in three views for each subject, allowing for a quick quality inspection. Your browser does not support the video tag. Functional Data Quality Since head movement during the acquisition of a functional MRI time series can be detrimental for the eventual data analysis and results, volume-to-volume head movement parameters are typically inspected as a quality indicator of fMRI data. Framewise displacement (FD) captures head movement in a single value per volume, resulting in an FD time series per functional run. Below we present interactive distribution plots of FD values for all participants over all runs of the 7T dataset. Distributions and an example time series are also presented for a single subject and a single run. 7T Audio Movie Data: 20 Subjects 7T Audio Movie Data: 1 Subject, 8 Runs 7T Audio Movie Data: 1 Subject, 1 Run","tags":"pages","url":"https://www.studyforrest.org/explore.html","loc":"https://www.studyforrest.org/explore.html"},{"title":"StudyForrest","text":"What is StudyForrest ? The human brain processes vast amounts of diverse input that are continuously gathered across the senses. However, most experiments study the brain via simplified stimuli that do little to resemble the complexity of a natural environment — a mismatch that must be addressed if we are to better understand how the brain works. This project centers around the use of the movie Forrest Gump , which provides complex sensory input that is both reproducible and is also richly laden with real-life-like content and contexts. Since its initial release, the StudyForrest dataset has grown and been extended substantially and now encompasses many hours of fMRI scans , structural brain scans, eye-tracking data, and extensive annotations of the movie. Explore the Data Page to more closely examine the data we have available. How Can You Use It? Neuroscience Researchers This is a one-of-a-kind resource for studying high-level cognition in the human brain under complex, natural stimulation. Furthermore, the versatility of the provided data (some individuals have almost ten hours of fMRI data), enables studies far beyond this main focus. This covers a vast range from studies of low-level signal properties and brain structure, over sensory integration and attentional processes, to computational modeling of representational spaces and brain area interactions. Take a look the List of Publications to get inspired. Scientific Developers The StudyForrest project provides ideal reference datasets for brain imaging. It's a comprehensive, modular, multi-modal, real-world dataset — making it an optimal choice when benchmarking algorithms or comparing implementations across projects. Liberally licensed ( PDDL ) and hosted across many different services (OpenNeuro, GIN, etc) with fine-grained access options, the StudyForrest dataset is easily accessible and is ready to be integrated into your CI infrastructure. Everyone — and You Not keen on brain research? This project still has something to offer to you! For example, our effort to analyze the structure of the movie Forrest Gump and annotate its properties expands the breadth of topics that can be explored. Check out the Data Page for more specifics. What we're most interested in is applications and inquiries that we have not anticipated — both within the field of neuroscience and beyond. So please, invent applications and explore ideas you have that we aren't even aware of... and do tell us about them! How are People Using It? This dataset has been used in over two dozen studies to investigate particular research questions or to validate novel tools and algorithms.

[…] A critical analysis of cortical parcellation protocols from FreeSurfer, BrainSuite, BrainVISA and BrainGyrusMapping revealed major limitations. — Mikhael et al., NeuroImage, 2018 […] We reveal here that hippocampal activity measured by fMRI during film watching is both sensitive and specific to event boundaries, identifying a potential mechanism whereby event boundaries shape experience by modulation of hippocampal activity. — Ben-Yakov & Henson, J Neuroscience, 2018 […] magnetic resonance advection imaging might have future potential to contribute to the modeling of the cerebrovascular system and to serve as a biomarker for cerebrovascular disease. — Voss et al., Journal of Cerebral Blood Flow & Metabolism, 2016 This also opens the door for the identification of shared and individual [brain] responses […] to assess the degree to which functional topography is shared across subjects. We posit that this technique can be adapted to examine an array of situations where group differences are the key experimental variable. — Chen et al, NIPS, 2015","tags":"pages","url":"https://www.studyforrest.org/index.html","loc":"https://www.studyforrest.org/index.html"},{"title":"Publications","text":"This page lists publications that either describe data provided by the StudyForrest project, or studies using these data or protocols.
