  <p><strong>Understand how the brain works, in real life.</strong></p>
<p>In order to fully understand how the brain works, it is essential to study
the complex inter-play of cognitive processes that are characteristic when
interacting with a rich natural environment. Going beyond the localization
of individual aspects of brain function is pivotal as there are clear
limits to what we can learn about the function of the brain as whole via
restricting investigation to specialized cognitive sub-systems in feature
deprived laboratory settings.</p>
<p>The increasing number of publications focused on multivariate and
data-driven analysis of brain network dynamics is a clear indication that
neuroimaging research embraces this challenge, both on a conceptual and
methodological level.</p>
<p>Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data is by far
the most commonly used brain imaging paradigm in this emerging domain.  It can
be argued that this is due to the fact that it can be easily obtained at
relatively low cost, and, even more importantly, it is more frequently shared
(e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/">1000 FCP</a>) than any other brain
imaging data.</p>
<p>However, rs-fMRI data imposes strict constraints on the kinds of analyses
it can be used for. For example, it is not meaningful to directly study the
change in brain activity patterns through time across a group of
participants, as there is no rich (time-locked) sensory stimulation at the
time of data acquisition.</p>
<p>Quasi-naturalistic stimulation, for example by watching a movie, represents an
alternative paradigm that is compatible with most methods developed for
rs-fMRI, but additionally enables studies of the dynamics of neural processes
across multiple individuals in real life contexts. In their recent review,
<a class="reference external" href="http://hlab.princeton.edu/Papers/hasson_honey_neuroimage_2012.pdf">Hasson and Honey (2012)</a>
identified this approach as an emerging trend that is likely to play a major
role in brain imaging research over the next decade.</p>
<p>There are two main challenges that will determine the success of this
approach in terms of both quality and quantity of scientific output:</p>
<div class="section" id="availability-of-real-life-cognition-data">
<h2>Availability of real-life cognition data</h2>
<p><strong>More well-described data is needed.</strong></p>
<p>At present, there are very few datasets available to study complex brain
function in real life contexts. In this project, we have gathered and
published a large dataset comprising of a versatile set of brain imaging
techniques. All data was released freely into the public domain to
facilitate contributions by independent research groups and scientists from
other disciplines. We will continue to extend this dataset with more data
modalities and stimulation paradigms. However, a single dataset and the
resources of a single imaging center will not be enough to address the need
for appropriate data.</p>
<p>The challenge is to provide the scientific community with data in a form
that facilitates re-use, and integration of results and derived or
processed data with the original dataset in order to enable incremental
research for the community at large.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="analysis-strategies-to-study-complex-concurrent-neural-processes">
<h2>Analysis strategies to study complex concurrent neural processes</h2>
<p><strong>Reliable, and readily usable analysis techniques are needed.</strong></p>
<p>Over the past years many new techniques have been developed for
multivariate, data-driven analysis of brain imaging data, for example
various brain parcellation procedures. At present it is
unclear how reliable these tools work in real life contexts. Often there
are significant technical hurdles that prevent an efficient evaluation of
these new tools before they get integrated with one of the major data
analysis suites.  Consequently, it is all-too-common for such new
methodologies to take years to get adopted by the neuroimaging research
community.</p>
<p>The challenge is to reduce this time-to-adoption by facilitating the
(crowd-sourced) evaluation of new algorithms with public data for
benchmarks, promotion of scientific results in close proximity to the
relevant datasets, and integration of algorithm implementations in readily
usable form, for example via a ready-made computational environment that is
freely available to anyone.</p>

application. The best three contributions will receive an <strong>award</strong> (3000,
1500, and 500 Euro respectively) sponsored by the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cbbs.eu">Center for Behavioral Brain
Sciences</a>, Magdeburg, Germany.</p>
